parallel_universe makes the setup of complex boardgames fast and easy.

It will hand out setup tasks to each player to minimize setup time, so that none of the players are sitting around wondering what to do. Eventually, players will be able to use a web interface on their mobile devices to work through their setup tasks.

Why?
----
Eclipse takes forever to set up. So does Mansions of Madness. If only all six players could start grabbing the cardboard bits and get them in the right places without waiting on the one person holding the rulebook, we could get down to the fun part sooner.
